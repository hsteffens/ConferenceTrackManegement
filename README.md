# ConferenceTrackManegement

Problem Statement - Conference Track Management

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.

Implemented solution:
- Read all tracks and ordered them to highest to lowest.
- Performed a bubble sort to find the best track for each time.
